## About
These pages document my past, present and future research works. I summarize these works with publication/code links where applicable.
You will also find tutorials, writings and musings on various topics on python programming, machine learning, spectroscopy, statistics and probability.

I obtained my PhD in Physical Chemistry from the University of Florida doing research in Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). I investigated the use of molecular species formed during LIBS as an analytical quantification technique.

After my doctorate, I did a one year postdoc at the Optical Science Center for Applied Research in Delaware. Whiles there,  I did work on using machine learning on LIBS spectra for detecting ovarian cancer in mice.

I also did another postdoc at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell on using LIBS together with machine learning for the detection of melanoma cancer and Alzheimers using biological samples. I also did NASA-sponsored researches on; simulating the LIBS process, use of machine learning to preprocess LIBS spectra at scale and automating the fitting of emission lines in LIBS spectra.

I am currently a Senior Algorithms Development Scientist at [Nova Measuring Instruments](https://www.novami.com/) where I write python and MATLAB codes to process XPS, XRF or SIMS data.
